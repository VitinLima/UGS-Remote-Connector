Allow UGS (Universal GCode Sender) to connect to a CNC machine through a TCP server on a raspberry pi connected to the machine

In order to launch the code on boot on the rasp, use crontab:

> crontab -e
Add the following line to the crontab file:
@reboot sleep 10 && USER=pi programdir=<fullpath-to-the-repository> {$programdir}/cnc.sh >{$programdir}/log.txt 2>&1

Connect to the lab wifi, launch UGS and connect to the TCP server: host=cncpi port=4444
To troubleshoot, connect to the rasp through SSH: ssh pi@cncpi.local
