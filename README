Allow UGS (Universal GCode Sender) to connect to a CNC machine through a TCP server on a raspberry pi connected to the machine

In order to launch the code on boot on the rasp, use crontab:

> crontab -e
Add the following line to the crontab file:
@reboot sleep 10 && USER=pi programdir=<fullpath-to-the-repository> {$programdir}/cnc.sh >{$programdir}/log.txt 2>&1

Connect to the lab wifi, launch UGS and connect to the TCP server: host=cncpi port=4444
To troubleshoot, connect to the rasp through SSH: ssh pi@cncpi.local

Beware pyserial is required to connect to the cnc, and accessing the usb port requires special permissions on linux. The sleep in crontab serves to wait until the system has finished booting before launching, and the user pi (or whatever user) must be in dialout group (sudo adduser pi dialout)

For testing, you can use this line in crontab instead:
* * * * * USER=pi programdir=<fullpath-to-the-repository> {$programdir}/cnc.sh >{$programdir}/log.txt 2>&1
This will launch the application everyminute, instead of having to reboot the rasp everytime

Script to run on fresh rasp ("yes | init-script.sh" for skipping all yes/no prompts so you can go brew your coffee while you wait :D ):
sudo apt update                              
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install pip
sudo pip install pyserial
sudo apt install git
